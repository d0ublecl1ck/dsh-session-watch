/**
 * Pure counting rules for the Session Watch status readout.
 *
 * No framework, no DOM: the browser half (through the client bundle) and the
 * Node tests both import this module, so the definition of every number the
 * plugin shows lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * Scope ("ordinary Session"), shared by every metric:
 * - subagent child Sessions are excluded — they are part of a parent's work;
 * - blank Sessions are excluded — they are the reusable "New Session" seat
 *   rather than a conversation.
 *
 * The six metrics are then two independent splits of that scope:
 * - archive:   archived vs unarchived;
 * - activity:  the unarchived rows fold into exactly one of
 *   pending / running / unread / idle, in that precedence order.
 *
 * The precedence makes the four activity numbers a partition: their sum is
 * always the unarchived count, so the readout can never double-count a Session
 * that is, say, running while it waits for an approval.
 *
 * @module dsh-session-watch/count
